###### STABLE
# SDL (Steam Deck Launcher)

SDL can be used to open the new Steam Deck UI on Windows PC's and making it feel native by settings the Shell to Steam, when logging out for convience you will be returned to the Login screen.

Please carefully read between the differences between REG and NONREG version

###### REG
This version will automatically add the needed registry change to replace the shell, due to this you MUST run the installer from an administrator account you want to apply the shell to.

###### NONREG
This version will install SDL wihtout making the needed chnage to the registry. You can manually add the value after if wanted. Reg file stored in:
> SETUP > REG

### SDLSL (Shortcut Launcher)
The installer inlcudes the required files to use SDSL. SDSL allows for any number of shortcuts to be launched when the account logs in, this can be useful for opening media apps such as Spotify and utilities such as Google Drive, DSX.

# EXPLAINING THE VERSION SCHEME
The version number is split into 3, such as at time of writing the latest beta build version : 0.2.5, each  number relates to the following

- 0 - Stable branch long term version - the first digit tells you the main version it is based on.
- 2 - Stable branch incremental update - Minor updates to the version such as bug fixes or small festures.
- 5 - BETA branch - this is for beta builds, a beta build can be from 1 - 9, due to how small the program is i would not recomend installing the betas as they are just me testing so may not work or the installer may be "bare bones".

### Upcoming
- BETA Version: 1.0.1 Preparing for STABLE version 1.5.0
- BETA Version: 1.0.2
- STABLE Version: 1.5.0 split main directory into 2 version, reg and nonreg.
update nonreg version to be more like a program

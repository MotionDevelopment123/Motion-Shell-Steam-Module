# SDL Version: 1.5.0.0

### Prerequisites:
- latest Steam or Steam beta installed.
- Administrator rights and the ability to create a new user account.
- 2nd user account

### Other recommendations:
- Ensure games and launchers (including Steam are installed to a directory that all users can access such as ```C:\Program Files\``` to prevent issues accessing games)
- turn on cloud sync for all possible games, any you're unable to sync you will need to manual set the save location to public directory like the game folder or remlink the folder

### NEVER INSTALL TO YOUR MAIN/ ONLY ACCOUNT, ONLY USE A SECONDARY ACCOUNT!
This is to ensure IF something went wrong you're not left with a black screen and can just remove the 2nd user account and create a new one to start over.

If you have installed the ```REG``` version then all you need to do is logout and back in after installation for the changes to take effect

If you have installed the ```NONREG``` version then SDL is not set as your windows shell but can be launched from the ```.EXE```

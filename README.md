# SDL (Steam Deck Launcher)
##### BETA

###### SDL can be used to turn your Windows PC into a Steam Deck. By replacing the Windows Shell with the new big picture mode from Steam this provides a experance similar to what you would find using a Steam Deck.

### Features
###### DUE TO RESTARTING THE PROJECT MORE FEATURES AND UPDATES TO COME!
- Launch directly into Steam's new big picture mode when signing into PC account
- Ability to switch to desktop mode and back into game mode (when in big pcture mode exit steam this will trigger desktop mode to launch which has a shortcut to return to gaming mode)

### WARNING!
This will modify a registry key, when installing ensure your using a secondary profile (NEVER USE THE ONLY PC PROFILE ALWAYS CREATE A SEPERATE ONE!) and if administrator provilages are required the account it is being installed to is the one to grant them.

###### NONREG
This version has been discontinued as the project has changed to more closely mimic the behaviour of games mode on the Steam Deck.

### SDLSL (Shortcut Launcher)
The installer inlcudes the required files to use SDSL. SDSL allows for any number of shortcuts to be launched when the account logs in, this can be useful for opening media apps such as Spotify and utilities such as Google Drive, DSX.

### Upcoming
- Project has been re-written to be more like the Steam Deck, more coming soon!

# Motion-Shell Steam Module
Motion-Shell Steam Module can be used to replace the Windows Shell with the new big picture mode from Steam this provides an experience similar to what can be found using the Steam Deck.

### Features
- Launch directly into Steam's new big picture mode when signing into PC account
- Change what happens when you close Steam (lets you choose between Windows-Shell, logout and custom during installation)
- relaunch to SDL mode from the desktop without having to log out and back in (Create shortcut of the Return To Gaming Mode.exe on the desktop from C:\Motion-Shell\Steam\)

### WARNING!
This will modify a registry key, when installing ensure your using a secondary profile (**NEVER USE THE ONLY PC PROFILE ALWAYS CREATE A SEPERATE ONE!**).

# SDL Version: 3.0.0.2

### Prerequisite:
- latest Steam or Steam beta installed
- 2nd user account to install SDL too.

### Other recommendations:
- Ensure games and launchers including Steam are installed to a directory that all users can access such as `C:\Program Files\` to prevent issues accessing games)
- turn on cloud sync for all possible games, any you're unable to sync you will need to manual set the save location to public directory like the game folder.

### **NEVER INSTALL TO YOUR MAIN/ ONLY ACCOUNT, ONLY USE A SECONDARY ACCOUNT!**
**This is to ensure IF something went wrong you're not left with a black screen and can just remove the 2nd user account and create a new one to start over.**
